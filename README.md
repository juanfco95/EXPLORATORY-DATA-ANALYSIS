# EXPLORATORY-DATA-ANALYSIS
Practice of the Data Mining course using R-Studio. It consists of the exploration of a data set "auto-mpg.data" whose objective is not only to prepare the data to work with, but also to try to extract relevant information from the different samples contained in the data set. 

The practice was sumbited in html format, and I do not have the .rmd file anymore but you can download it and visualize the results obtained.
